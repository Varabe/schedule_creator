# Unischeduler

## THIS APP IS DEPRECATED. NOW YOU CAN USE UNISCHEDULER FROM HTTPS://SCHEDULER.OATMEAL.CC

## Users
* This app is intended for students in universities where Oracle Peoplesoft Campus Solutions is used (if your student self service is absolutely horrible, your university probably uses PCS)
* Unischeduler converts your schedule from text to an icalendar format to export into any known calendar service (google calendar, apple calendar, outlook calendar, etc)
* To use it, go to releases and download the appropriate file for your platform
* This is only a graphical interface for [unischeduler](https://github.com/Ovsyanka83/unischeduler) which is a separate command line program

## Developers

* Python 3.7 intended
* Install dependencies through requirements.txt
* Run build.py to build the project
